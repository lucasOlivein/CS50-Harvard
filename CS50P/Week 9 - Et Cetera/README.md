# 🧠 Final Project
After solved each and every course's problem, it's time to the final project, a Python program of your very own! The design and implamentation is entirely up to you, albeit subject to these requirements:
## ⚙️ Requirements
### 🐍 Implementation
- ⬜ The project must be implemented in Python.

### 🧩 Functions
- ⬜ The main function must be in `project.py`, located in the root folder.
- ⬜ Define at least **three additional functions** in `project.py`, at the same indentation level as `main`.

### 🧪 Testing
- ⬜ At least **three** of those *additional functions* must be accompanied by tests that can be executed with **pytest**.
- ⬜ The test functions must be in a file called `test_project.py`, which should also be in the “root” of your project. 
- ⬜ Be sure they have the same name as your custom functions, prepended with test_ (test_custom_function, for example, where custom_function is a function you’ve implemented in `project.py`).

### 📦 Additional Requirements
- ⬜ You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions as you see fit beyond the minimum requirement.
- ⬜ Implementing your project should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets.
- ⬜ Any pip-installable libraries that your project requires must be listed, one per line, in a file called `requirements.txt` in the root of your project.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 💭  Q1.  What will your software do?
_What features will it have? How will it be executed?_

1. > 💬 In the beginning, it will draw **basic shapes** such as triangles, squares, and circles. Later, it will support **3D objects** like cubes, pyramids, and spheres.
2. > 💬 Then, it will include **input support** to select or modify objects and to control the **camera perspective** through rotation, scaling, and translation.
3. > 💬 Finally, it will have a **logic module** responsible for handling geometric forms and transformations.
  

### 📘 Q2. What new skills will you need to acquire?
_What topics will you need to research?_

1. > 💬 I’ll need to learn how to use the **Pygfx library** and understand how to apply **linear transformations**.
2. > 💬 I’ll also review the **Unit Tests** (Week 5) topic from the course to explore how testing can be applied in this project’s context.
3. > 💬 I might also use **Object-Oriented Programming** (Week 8), implementing a **base class** to represent geometric objects and **derived classes** for specific shapes such as triangles, spheres, and so on.

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

## 📤 Submittion
### 🎬 Step 1 of 3
- ⬜ Create a short video to present your project to the world.
    - Should have no more than 3 minutes in length.
- ⬜ Your video must begin with an opening section that displays:
    - Your project’s title.
    - Your name.
    - Your GitHub and edX usernames.
    - Your city and country.
    - The date you have recorded this video.

### 📝  Step 2 of 3
- ✅ Create a `README.md` text file (named exactly that!) in your ~/project folder that explains your project. 
- ⬜ This file should include:
    - ✅ The project title. 
    - ⬜ The URL of your video (created in step 1 above).
    - ⬜ A description of your project. 
- ✅ You may use the below as a template.
    ```
     # YOUR PROJECT TITLE
    #### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
    #### Description:
    TODO
    ```

### 🏁 Step 3 of 3
That’s it! Your project should be graded within a few minutes.
