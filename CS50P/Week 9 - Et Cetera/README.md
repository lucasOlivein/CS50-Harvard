# 🧠 Final Project

## ⚙️ Requirements
### 🐍 Implementation
- ⬜ The project must be implemented in Python.

### 🧩 Functions
- ⬜ The main function must be in `project.py`, located in the root folder.
- ⬜ Define at least **three additional functions** in `project.py`, at the same indentation level as `main`.

### 🧪 Testing
- ⬜ At least **three** of those *additional functions* must be accompanied by tests that can be executed with **pytest**.
- ⬜ The test functions must be in a file called `test_project.py`, which should also be in the “root” of your project. 
- ⬜ Be sure they have the same name as your custom functions, prepended with test_ (test_custom_function, for example, where custom_function is a function you’ve implemented in `project.py`).

### 📦 Additional Requirements
- ⬜ You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions as you see fit beyond the minimum requirement.
- ⬜ Implementing your project should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets.
- ⬜ Any pip-installable libraries that your project requires must be listed, one per line, in a file called `requirements.txt` in the root of your project.
