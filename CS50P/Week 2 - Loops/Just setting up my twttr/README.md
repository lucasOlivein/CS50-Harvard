## 📌 Task

Implement a program in **Python** that prompts the user for a **string of text**  
and outputs that same text but with all **vowels** removed.  

- Vowels to remove: `A, E, I, O, U` (both uppercase and lowercase).  

---

### ⚙️ Requirements
- Input may contain **letters, numbers, punctuation, or spaces**.  
- Only vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) must be removed — all other characters remain unchanged.  
- Output must preserve the **original order** of the remaining characters.  

---

### 💡 Hints

- Recall that strings are iterable character by character.  
- Skip vowels when building the new string.  
- Use `.lower()` to simplify comparisons.
