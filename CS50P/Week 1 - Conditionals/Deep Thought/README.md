# 🧠 Deep Thought  
## 📌 Task

Implement a program in **Python** that prompts the user for the answer to  
the *Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything*, outputting:

- ✅ **Yes** → if the user inputs `42`, `forty-two`, or `forty two` (case-insensitive).  
- ❌ **No** → for any other input.  

---

### ⚙️ Requirements
- The program must handle both **numeric** and **textual** inputs.  
- Text inputs should be matched in a **case-insensitive** way.  

---
### 💡 Hints

- No need to convert the user’s input to an int if you check for equality with "42", a str, rather than 42, an int!
- It’s okay if your output or the user’s wraps onto multiple lines.
