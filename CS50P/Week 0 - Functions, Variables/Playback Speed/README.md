## 📌 Task

Implement a program in **Python** that prompts the user for input  
and then outputs that same input, replacing each space (` `) with `...` (three periods).

---

### ⚙️ Requirements

- Every space in the input must be replaced with three periods.  
- All other characters should remain unchanged.  
- You may prompt the user explicitly (e.g., by passing a string as an argument to `input`),  
  but it is not required.  

---

### 💡 Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a string.  
- Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods.
