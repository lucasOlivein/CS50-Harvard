# 😃 Making Faces

## 📌 Task

Implement a function called **`convert`** that accepts a string as input and returns that same input with:

- `:)` converted to 🙂 (*slightly smiling face*)  
- `:(` converted to 🙁 (*slightly frowning face*)  

All other text should be returned unchanged.

---

### ⚙️ Requirements

- Implement a function **`main`** that:  
  1. Prompts the user for input.  
  2. Calls **`convert`** on that input.  
  3. Prints the result.  
- You may prompt the user explicitly (e.g., by passing a string as an argument to `input`),  
  but it is not required.  
- Be sure to call **`main`** at the bottom of your file.

---
### 💡 Hints

- Recall that `input` returns a string.  
- Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods
- An emoji is actually just a character, so you can quote it like any str, a la "😐".
