# Meteorite Cleaning

### 🚀 Summary
...
### 📄 Description (Adapted)
...
### ⚙️ Specification

📌 **Task**: In `import.sql`, write a series of SQL (and SQLite) statements to import and clean the data from `meteorites.csv` into a table, `meteorites`, in a database called `meteorites.db`.

Within `meteorites.db`, the meteorites table should have the following columns:

- <details><summary>Columns in the <code>meteorites</code> table</summary>

    --- 
    - `id`, which represents the unique ID of the meteorite.
    - `name`, which represents the given name of the meteorite.
    - `class`, which is the classification of the meteorite, according to the traditional classification scheme.
    - `mass`, which is the weight of the meteorite, in grams.
    - `discovery`, which is either “Fell” or “Found”. “Fell” indicates the meteorite was seen falling to Earth, whereas “Found” indicates the meteorite was found only after landing on Earth.
    - `year`, which is the year in which the the meteorite was discovered.
    - `lat`, which is the latitude at which the meteorite landed.
    - `long`, which is the longitude at which the meteorite landed.

<details><summary>📋 <strong>Requirements</strong></summary>

1.  ⬜  Any empty values in `meteorites.csv` are represented by `NULL` in the `meteorites` table. 
    - Keep in mind that the mass, year, lat, and long columns have empty values in the CSV.
2.  ⬜  All columns with decimal values (e.g., 70.4777) should be rounded to the nearest hundredths place (e.g., 70.4777 becomes 70.48). 
    - Keep in mind that the mass, lat, and long columns have decimal values.
3.  ⬜  All meteorites with the `nametype` “Relict” are not included in the `meteorites` table.
4.  ⬜  The meteorites are sorted by `year`, oldest to newest, and then—if any two meteorites landed in the same year—by `name`, in alphabetical order.
5.  ⬜  You’ve updated the IDs of the meteorites from `meteorites.csv`, according to the order specified in #4. 
    - The `id` of the meteorites should start at 1, beginning with the meteorite that landed in the oldest year and is the first in alphabetical order for that year.

- <details><summary> Begin by importing meteorites.csv into a temporary table</summary>

    ---
    _Start by getting all of the data from `meteorites.csv` into a temporary table, one called `meteorites_temp`. A temporary table is a helpful placeholder: you can use it to clean your data until it’s in a form that’s suitable for your final meteorites table._

    _Before you import a CSV into a SQLite database, it’s best to define the schema for the table into which that data will be imported. In import.sql, then, try the following:_

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE "meteorites_temp" (
    -- TODO
    );
    ```
    We’ll leave the column names up to you.

    Next, recall that `.import` is a SQLite statement that can import a CSV into a table of your choice. After your `CREATE TABLE` statement, write a `.import` statement to import the data from `meteorites.csv` into the `meteorites_temp` table.

    Finally, try creating `meteorites.db` by running the statements in `import.sql`.

- <details><summary>Write SQL statements to clean the imported data</summary>

    ---
    _With your data in a temporary table, continue writing SQL statements to clean the data. Consider how you might update the values of the `mass` column for instance:_
    ```sql
    UPDATE "meteorites_temp"
    SET "mass" = ...
    WHERE ...
    ```
    _You might need to write a few such statements, one (or more) for each column you’re trying to clean._
    </details>

- <details><summary>Transfer the data from your temporary table into a meteorites table</summary>

    ---
    Recall that you can `INSERT` values into a new table by `SELECT`ing rows from another:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO "table0" ("column0", "column1")
    SELECT "column0", "column1" FROM "table1";
    ```

    _When you do so, you can re-order your data using ORDER BY. And, so long as you’ve specified a primary key column in your new table, such a statement will auto-assign new IDs to the inserted rows if none is specified._ 

    _Once you’re done with the temporary table, it’s good practice to drop it!_
